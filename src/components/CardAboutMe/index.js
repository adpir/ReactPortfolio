//                                     A true creative at heart both on and off of the computer, I have always enjoyed making things work
//                                     and look the way that they should. Born in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, I always dreamed of
//                                     coming to the states to immerse myself in the culture and learn English. I moved here 11 years ago
//                                     and have been in Minneapolis ever since. I have a bachelors in Theatre, have always been involved in
//                                     the arts, and love finding new ways to get creative.
//                                     I have been working at a software company for the last five years and recently, I completed a full
//                                     stack advanced coding program at the University of Minnesota that expanded my creative toolbelt
//                                     immensely. I enjoy tackling problems, have a strong range of leadership experience in multiple
//                                     fields of work, and work well with others. Recently I was nominated as a “Transformer” by the team I
//                                     lead for my hard work and dedication within the company. I look forward to opportunities to create
//                                     or augment existing systems in ways that ‘wow’ people and make a real, long lasting impressions.
