 and look the way that they should. Born in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, I always dreamed of coming to the states to immerse myself in the culture and learn English. I moved here 11 years ago and have been in Minneapolis ever since. I have a bachelor's in Theatre, have always been involved in the arts, and love finding new ways to get creative. I worked for over six years at a software company. I recently completed a full-stack software engineer coding program at the University of Minnesota that expanded my creative toolbelt immensely. I enjoy tackling problems, have a strong range of leadership experience in multiple fields of work, and work well with others. Recently I was nominated as a "Transformer" by the team I
 lead for my hard work and dedication within the company. I look forward to opportunities to create
 or augment existing systems in ways that 'wow' people and make real, long-lasting impressions.`,
